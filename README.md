# Kids Welcome! -- Predicting child-friendliness of restaurant and food businesses from Yelp data

This repo collects a reproducible research report written as capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization by Johns Hopkins University. Based on the [6th Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), I am comparing four machine-learning models to predict which restaurant and food venues are likely to be child-friendly. The final model is a Random Forest classifier with an AUROC of 0.9, a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 54%. All code written in R.
